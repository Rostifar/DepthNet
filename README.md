A Tensorflow interface for the paper: Predicting Depth, Surface Normals and Semantic Labels with a Common Multi-Scale Convolutional Architecture

+Included is a simple implementation of the aforementioned paper; however, it must be noted that this repository does not include the finalized weights for the model. Also, this model has only been tested on the CPU version of tensorflow.
